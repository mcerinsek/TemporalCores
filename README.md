# Temporal Cores

Resources:
- network structure: https://github.com/bavla/Graph
- algorithm: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.00200v1.pdf

TODO:
- check EdgeRemoval and EdgeInsertion
- upgrade

Usage:

Check the Run.py where you can find an example. Algorithms for core maintenance during edge/node removal/insertion are in separate files with corresponding file names. Computations.py holds auxiliary functions.
